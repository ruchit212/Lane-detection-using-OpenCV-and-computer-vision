# Lane-detection-using-OpenCV-and-computer-vision
I have learned fundamentals of computer vision with using open cv library. The aim of this project to detect a lane and helps driver to track the lane.

As a human driver, it is hard to remain in the correct lane and to keep the following proper gap with the road lanes, as the driver needs to focus on the road for an extended time.to solve this issue Computer vision enables autonomous vehicles to recognise and track the lane marking on the road. The aim of this project is to helps drivers to drive perfectly with the lanes and tracks the lane.
